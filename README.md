# Distributed Systems Lab

Hands-on exercises and mini-projects for the **Distributed Systems** course.

## Overview
This repository contains lab work exploring core distributed systems concepts through practical implementations:
- **Custom communication protocols** (message framing, serialization, reliability strategies)
- **Containerization & orchestration** with **Docker** and **Kubernetes**
- **Cloud primitives on AWS**: **EC2** (compute), **S3** (storage), **Lambda** (serverless), plus IAM & networking basics
